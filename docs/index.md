# Welcome to Codecats CV

The aim of this course is to give you a glimpse into the world of web development as it is practiced today. The main challenge for a newcomer is that there is a vast array of technologies and languages to get a grasp on before you are able to understand how it all works.

In this course we are trying to give you a basic understanding about one possible technology stack by building a complete application that makes use of all the technologies and brings them together.

As we will cover the complete process from idea to implementation and deployment the actual application is pretty simple but is actually already usable as an online CV. Use this as a starting point to learn more about Python and web development while customizing the CV to your own needs.

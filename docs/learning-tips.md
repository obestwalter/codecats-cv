# Learning to learn

## The most important thing ...

... you need to learn, when learning to program, is how to learn to use new technologies. Learning a new technology includes a whole range of things:

* What is the best (for my needs) implementation of that technology?
* Where is the best documentation?
* How do I start using it (installation, invokation, etc.)?
* What are the best tools to help me using the technology (developing, testing, debugging)?

## General Tips

Software development is it's own universe with different cultures, idioms, terminolgy, etc. - learning to program works best, if you immerse yourself into that universe and learn not just a programming langauge but the language of programming. If you know what to search for then Google can help you to learn everything you need.

# Good sources of knowledge
